 Recently, the number of "potholes" that are hollowed out due to cracks in roads in Korea has increased significantly. It snowed a lot in winter and the ground froze and melted due to the abnormal climate,
Potassium chloride is used to quickly remove snow, which seems to be the cause of problems with asphalt as it melts later.
This is causing accidents on the road and inconvenience on the road. In addition, evidence must be provided in order to treat the problem of potholes.
In order to solve this situation, it seems that the car itself should judge the pothole and drive away from it or inform the repair team so that it can be fixed.
Therefore, I want to learn this from artificial intelligence so that I can distinguish between port holes.

# Labeling for learning

For learning, potholes are labeled using DragLabel.
